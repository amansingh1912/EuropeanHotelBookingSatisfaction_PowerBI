## Overview:

* I got the dataset from Kaggle website which is regarding Hotel Booking and Customer Satisfaction based on different parameters.


## Key Questions with respect to the dataset:

* Gender Share overall.
* Average Age.
* Share of Different types and purposes of travel.
* Different types of booking share and satisfaction type.
* % satisfaction and % dissatisfaction based on 4 parameters: Type of Travel, Gender Type, Purpose of Travel and Age Groups.
* Average rating analysis overall.

## Tools Used: Power BI, Figma.


## Steps in the analysis:

* With respect to the given dataset, I fetched the data in Power BI.
* Then, I applied DAX measures to it to filter the data based on different age groups in 4 categories which are "Under 20", "21-30", "31-50" and "Above 50".
Also, used DAX measures to create those relevant measures required for the analysis.
* Afterwards, I created the layout in Figma for this 3 paged dashboard and used Power BI to create the entire report.

## Key Insights from the report:

* Average Wi-fi Service Rating is lowest whereas Average Other Service Rating is highest.
* Percentage satisfied for Personal purpose of travel is highest whereas % neutral or unsatisfied for Academic purpose of travel is highest.
* Percentage satisfied for Personal type of travel is highest whereas % neutral or unsatisfied for Academic purpose of travel is highest.
* Male with respect to femal are more satisfied.
* Age group 31-50 is the most satisfied whereas 21-30 is the least satisfied among all age groups.

## Conclusion:
Overall, it was a nice dataset to analyse and it gave me a good practice over usage of DAX Measures and analytical skills.
